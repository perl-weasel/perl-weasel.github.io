## Getting started

This instruction assumes you'll be using pherkin (Test::BDD::Cucumber)
to test your web application. Availability of a Selenium test setup is
a prerequisite and won't be covered. Installation of the Perl side and
integration with *Weasel* is in scope of this document.

Steps:

1. Install dependencies
2. Create the first PageObject
3. Install Perl BDD tools and integration
4. Write a BDD step with *Weasel*
5. Write a BDD feature using a *Weasel* step


### Install dependencies

In order to use *Weasel*, you need at least the following Perl packages
(and their dependencies) installed:

* *Weasel*
* *Weasel*::Driver::Selenium2

See [the instructions on Perl Maven](https://perlmaven.com/how-to-install-a-perl-module-from-cpan)
on how to install Perl modules and their dependencies for your platform.
